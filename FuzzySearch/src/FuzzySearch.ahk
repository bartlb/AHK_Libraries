/**
 * Creates an array of match objects using a custom search technique based on a mix of
 * fuzzy search and LCS algoritms. 
 * 
 * Before the search is initiated the query is split into individual characters, and then
 * joined again by a regex wildcard -- though if query is blank or 'dict' is not an array
 * the function will fail, returning 0. The search then begins by looping through the
 * array of strings and attempting to validate a match by using a basic fuzzy search. If
 * a match is found, the function will attempt to locate the best match for the query,
 * rather than just submitting the first match (left-to-right); the 'best match' is
 * determined by a weight system which holds matches at the begining of a string, new 
 * words (seen as characters separated by a standard word boundary '\b' or an underscore)
 * and capitals as identifiers of a better match. The weight system is fairly basic. In
 * order, matches are weighted as follows:
 * 1. The percent of characters in the string that the query covers, as a whole number.
 *    i.e. Round((QUERY_LENGTH / STRING_LENGTH) * 100)
 * 2. The first character in the query matches the first character in a string (+50).
 * 3. A character in the query matches the first letter of a new word in a string (+25).
 * 4. A character in the quert matches any uppercase letter in a given string (+10).
 * 5. Any other match (+1).
 *
 * @function  FuzzySearch
 * @param     [in]      dict    An array of strings to query against.
 * @param     [in]      query   Any query in the form of a string.
 * @returns   {object}          An array of match objects consisting of the matched
 *                              string and information pertaining to where the match
 *                              occured within the string.
